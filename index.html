	<h2>Conversion Table</h2>
		<p>Sometimes recipes will give you measurements, but your spoons and cups are in a different measurement. This table may help you with converting teaspoons to milliliters.</p>
		<p>1 teaspoon is equal to 4.929 Milliliters, so you can calculate the conversion by multiplying the number of teaspoons by 4.929, as shown below.</p>
		<table border="1">
			<tr>
				<th rowspan="4" id="table_name">Conversion Table</th>
				<th>Tsp</th>
				<th>Milliliter</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>1</td>
				<td>4.9289</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2</td>
				<td>9.858</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>3</td>
				<td>14.787</td>
			</tr>

		<h2>Other Website Review</h2>
			<p>For my website review, I searched for another website that would have some cooking information authored by a person also named Lina...and I actually found someone! She has a recipe <a href="http://lina-recipe.blogspot.com/">blog</a> that has a ton of different recipes posted.</p>
			<p>I looked at the source code for this website, and I don't know if I'm qualified enough to make a statement about whether the site was good or bad...but there were a few things that stuck out to me that may have swung the dial toward the "bad" side. <br>I noticed that the code for the header of the page was incredibly long, and it looked very repetitious. I think maybe that could be cleaned up a little bit to be fewer lines of code (but I don't know enough to really say that definitively). <br>I also noticed that they used the &lt;div&gt; tag, instead of a &lt;section&gt; tag to separate blog posts, which I thought was odd; in my readings when I was trying to figure out the difference, blog posts were an example of using section tags instead of div tags, so it would have been a good application in this case. <br>I did see that they used a lot of attributes in their tags though, so that was very good.</p>
