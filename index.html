				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<hr>
				<h2>Career</h2>
				<p>I am currently working at Expedia, Inc. as a Technical Product Manager on the Search Engine Marketing Engineering team. My goal was always to be a TPM, and I felt that in order to be empathetic and knowledgable about software developer processes, I should work as a Software Dev Engineering first. I started at Expedia in April 2017 as a Software Dev Engineer and after about 1.5 years, I felt comfortable to move to the TPM role. Expedia has such a wonderful culture and I really feel valued as an employee. I am learning a lot from my peers and hope to continue to grow in this role. 
				<br><br>
				My experience in Software Development along with my previous experience as an Industrial Engineer has been a very interesting combination that makes me a unique addition to any team. I am motivated by a desire to enrich the community by contributing my strong communication and leadership skills, attention to detail, and ability to bring teams together.
				<br><br>
				My goal in every step of my career is to build products that will help or educate people on how to improve their lives and communities. 
				<br><br>
				I am currently very happy in my role, but would love to chat with you about an innovative environment where I can offer my leadership, communication skills, and attention to detail. Please reach out via LinkedIn or email me at LinaCromer@gmail.com if you would like to talk more about available opportunities!</p>
				<h2>Life</h2>
				<p>I grew up in Boise, ID but have been living in Seattle for the last 10 years, and can't imagine leaving any time soon. In my free time, I love cooking, singing, and spending time with friends and family. I am always excited to try new restaurants and I'm always on the hunt for the city's best fries!</p>
