				<h2>TripTip</h2>
					<p>This is was my final project during Dev Bootcamp. My team of four created this web app to help people keep track of their vacation spots and share tips with friends. A user would be able to create a trip and tag certain businesses or tourist attractions on the map. They would also be able to attach notes and ratings to each tip. Friends would be able to view your trips and take use your notes and ratings to plan out trips of their own.</p>
					<p>Technologies used: Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Google Maps API, Bootstrap</p>

				<h2>PrincessGame</h2>
					<p>This is a little practice project that I did for fun with a partner. We took the game "Love Letter" and created a version that could be played online. One large device, such as a laptop or tablet, is put in the middle of the table to display the game board. Each of the players will log in to that game board using their cellphones, and everyone will play the game using their phones.</p>
